# Product Categorization Project

## Overview
The Product Categorization Project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the category of a product based on its attributes.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing
The project began by collecting product data from the Moncler website using web scraping techniques. Relevant information such as product name, description, characteristics, price, and colors were extracted. The collected data underwent thorough cleanup processes, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. Exploratory data analysis was conducted to gain insights into the dataset, revealing distributions and relationships between product attributes.

## Model Development
To achieve the project goals, various machine learning algorithms were explored, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and Random Forests. The data was preprocessed using techniques like one-hot encoding for categorical variables and scaling for numerical features. Each model was trained on the preprocessed data and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy. Hyperparameter tuning was employed to optimize model performance by searching for the best hyperparameter combinations.

## Results and Conclusions
The best-performing model was identified as a logistic regression model. This model achieved an impressive accuracy of 84% on the testing set, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately predicting product categories. The project yielded valuable insights into the factors influencing product categorization, highlighting the significance of attributes such as product name.
